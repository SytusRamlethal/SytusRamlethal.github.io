## 动态图

整体结构：

1. Intro：对标题进行重述；

2. Overview：对图表进行概述；

3. Details' Paragraph 1

4. Details' Paragraph 2

### Intro

Intro 的本质是将文章标题进行同义转换，并不需要做太多的事情。

> The graph below shows electricity production in France between 1980 and 2012.

一般的标题都是类似的形式，所以做法非常的公式，速度为王即可。以下是比较常见的替换：

| The graph/table/figure | The given graph       | The chart                 | The line/bar/pie chart           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| shows                  | illustrates           | compares                  | gives/provides information about |
| Between 1980 and 2012  | Over a xx-year period | Over a period of xx years |                                  |

遇到以产量、数量等相关的信息时，可以使用`the amount of xxx` 进行替换。

> The line chart illustrates the amount of electricity produced in France over a 30-year period.
>
> The given figure compares the amount of elctricity that was produced in Frence over a period of 30 years period.

### Overview

这段主要有两种写法：

1. 讲极值

这个方法适合图表中，最大值与最小值差距显著。

> It is clear that the most incidents and injuries took place on demand-response vehicles. By contrast, commuter rail services recorded by far the lowest figures.&#x20;

* 讲趋势

这个方法适合图表中，不同主体之间趋势差别明显。

> It is clear that spending on landline phones fell steadily over the 10-year period, while mobile phone expenditure rose quickly. The year 2006 marks the point at which expenditure on mobile services overtook that for residential phone services.&#x20;

### Detail Paragraphs

细节段则需要根据实际情况进行分析，但还是有比较万能的开头段：

1. Paragraph 1:

   1. Starting with xxx, ......

2. Paragraph 2:

   1. A similar trend can be found in xxx

   2. Looking at the chart in more detail, we see that ......

   3. It is worth noticing that ......

   4. XXX witnessed a xxx increase/decrease.

      1. XXX witnessed a turning point.
